# path of the design file in one of the accepted formats by ABC
design_file: my-design.blif

# the directory to hold the output of the iterations
output_dir: result

mapping:
  clock_period: 150   # in pico seconds
  library_file: my-library.lib

# the number of iterations for the greedy optimization
iterations: 100

# add more optimization to the toolbox
optimizations:
  - rewrite
  - rewrite -z
  - refactor
  - refactor -z
  - resub
  - resub -z
  - balance

# when the greedy algorithm get stuck, it applies one of the below post-mapping commands
post_mapping_commands:
- dnsize -D 150
- upsize -D 150
- buffer
